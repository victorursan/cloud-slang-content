The **cloud-slang-content** repository contains ready-made CloudSlang flows,
operations and tests for many common tasks as well as content that integrates
with several other systems.

Note: This repository may contain some beta content. Beta content is not verified
or tested by the CloudSlang team. Beta content is named with the `beta_` prefix.
The community is encouraged to assist in setting up testing environments for the
beta content.
